// whenever there's a wrong guess, we just take the score that we already have in our code, then we decrease it by one and then we display that new score right here.

// <74. Implementing the Game Logic>
// each time that there is a wrong guess, the score should decrease by one
// 1. to read the score from 'Score: 20', then decrease it by one and then print it there agian. store this score basically in the DOM, and to do that we could always just read the value from score label, so right from the DOM, then we could decrease that value and then write it back here to the DOM but then we could not have that value in our code so essentially our application would have no way of knowing that score at all points.
// 2. (better way) actually create a variable for the score in the code and then update that variable so bascially to decrease that variable nad then display the value of that variable here in this score label / by doing that, we have our data also in the code and not just on the DOM. It's always good to keep a variable which actually holds the data in our code and not just rely on the DOM to hold our data.
