// <143. Simple Array Methods>
// ‚úçÔ∏è methods are simply functions that we can call on objects. So basically, they are functions attached to objects. So if we have array methods, that means that arrays themselves are also objects and so these array methods are simply functions that are attached to all arrays that we create in JavaScript.
// üìù why all arrays have access to this methods: prototypal inheritance

// SLICE üó°Ô∏è
// ‚ö†Ô∏è this does not mutate the original arr array. Instead it returns a new array, so a copy of the array, but only with the extracted parts.
let arr = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e'];

console.log(arr.slice(2));
console.log(arr.slice(2, 4)); // ['c', 'd']
console.log(arr.slice(-2)); // ['d', 'e']
console.log(arr.slice(-1)); // ['e']
// -1 is always just the last element of any array
console.log(arr.slice(1, -2)); // ['b', 'c']
// except the last two

// simply create a shallow copy of any array
console.log(arr.slice()); // ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e']
// üëâ previously...
// creating new array, and then expanding the original array into that
console.log([...arr]); // ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e']
// personal preference; the only time you really need to use the slice method is when you want to chain multiple methods together, so calling one after the other

// SPLICE
// ‚ö†Ô∏è it does actually change the original array, so it mutates the array
// console.log(arr.splice(2)); // ['c', 'd', 'e']
// original array
// console.log(arr); // ['a', 'b']

// In practice, most of the time the value that the splice method returns, doesn't even interest us. All we are usually interested in is to just delete one or more elements from an array using splice.
// and one pretty common use case is to simply remove the last element of an array
// arr.splice(-1);
// console.log(arr); // ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd']

// üìé MDN documentation
// ‚ö†Ô∏è the second parameter is called deleteCount(not the begin parameter): the number of elements that we want to delete
arr.splice(-1);
console.log(arr);
arr.splice(1, 2);
console.log(arr); // ['a', 'd']

// REVERSE üôÉ
// ‚ö†Ô∏è` does actually mutate the original array
arr = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e'];
const arr2 = ['j', 'i', 'h', 'g', 'j', 'f'];
console.log(arr2.reverse()); // ['f', 'j', 'g', 'h', 'i', 'j']
console.log(arr2); // ['f', 'j', 'g', 'h', 'i', 'j']

// CONCAT üñáÔ∏è
// doesn't mutate the original array
const letters = arr.concat(arr2);
console.log(letters); // ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f', 'j', 'g', 'h', 'i', 'j']
// üëâ previously...
console.log([...arr, ...arr2]); // ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f', 'j', 'g', 'h', 'i', 'j']
// personal preference

// JOIN ü™°
console.log(letters.join(' - ')); // a - b - c - d - e - f - j - g - h - i - j

// <144. The new at Method>
const arr = [23, 11, 64];
console.log(arr[0]); // 23
console.log(arr.at(0)); // 23

// üìå getting last array element
console.log(arr[arr.length - 1]); // 64
console.log(arr.slice(-1)[0]); // 64
console.log(arr.at(-1)); // 64
// console.log(arr.at(-2)); // 11
// at method: get the last element of an array || start counting from the end of an array || do something called 'method chaining'
// []: quickly get a value from an array(ex. first element)

// ‚ûï also works on strings
console.log('choco'.at(0)); // c

// <145. Looping Arrays: forEach>
const movements = [200, 450, -400, 3000, -650, -130, 70, 1300];

  if (movement > 0) {
    console.log(`You deposited ${movement}`);
  } else {
    console.log(`You withdraw ${Math.abs(movement)}`);
  }
}

// forEach üõû
// 1. to loop over the array, and in each iteration it will execute the callback function
// 2. as the forEach method calls the callback function in each iteration, it will pass in the current element of the array as an argument

console.log('---- FOREACH ----');
movements.forEach(function (movement) {
  if (movement > 0) {
    console.log(`You deposited ${movement}`);
  } else {
    console.log(`You withdraw ${Math.abs(movement)}`);
  }
});
// 0: function(200)
// 1: function(450)
// 2: function(400)
// ...
// üëâ this is exactly the concept that I explained in the last section, when I said that we use a callback function to tell another higher-order function exactly what it should do, and so in this case we tell forEach that in each iteration, it should log one of these two strings here to the console. So we give the forEach method instructions by giving it a callback function which contains these instructions.

// üìå access to a counter variable
// ‚ö†Ô∏è notice that the order of the parameters is different in both scenarios
for (const [i, movement] of movements.entries()) {
  if (movement > 0) {
    console.log(`Movement ${i + 1}: You deposited ${movement}`);
  } else {
    console.log(`Movement ${i + 1}: You withdraw ${Math.abs(movement)}`);
  }
}

console.log('---- FOREACH ----');

  if (mov > 0) {
    console.log(`Movement ${i + 1}: You deposited ${mov}`);
  } else {
    console.log(`Movement ${i + 1}: You withdraw ${Math.abs(mov)}`);
  }
});

// ‚úçÔ∏è one fundamental difference between the two of them is that YOU CANNOT BREAK OUT OF A FOREACH LOOP. So the continue and break statements do not work in a forEach loop at all. So instead, forEach will always loop over the entire array and there is nothing that you can do about it.
// üëâ if you really need to break out of a loop, then you have to keep using the for of loop. But other than that, it really comes down to your personal preference.

// currenciesUnique.forEach(function (value, key, map) {

// });
// USD: USD
// GBP: GBP
// EUR: EUR
// what this means is that the key here is exactly the same as the value because a set doesn't have keys and it doesn't have indexes, either. And so there is no value that would make sense for the key.

// <150. Data Transformations: map, filter, reduce>
// ‚úçÔ∏è these are the methods that we use to CREATE NEW ARRAYS based on transforming data from other arrays

// üç´ map: yet another method that we can use to loop over arrays. So, map is actually similar to the forEach method, but with the difference that map creates a brand new array based on the original array. So essentially the map method takes an array, loops over that array, and in each iteration, it applies callback function that we specify on our code to the current array element.
// üëâ usually way more useful than in forEach method, because forEach simply allows us to do some work with each array element. But map on the other hand, builds us a brand new array containing the results of applying an operation to the original array.

// üç´ filter: is used to filter for elements in the original array which satisfy a certain condition.

// üç´ reduce: is used to boil down all the elements of the original array into ONE SINGLE VALUE(not new array)(snowball effect)

// <151. The map Method>
// convert movements from euros to US dollars
const eurToUsd = 1.1;

// const movementsUSD = movements.map(function (mov) {
//   return mov * eurToUsd;
// });

const movementsUSD = movements.map(mov => mov * eurToUsd);

console.log(movements);
console.log(movementsUSD);

// for of loop
const movementsUSDfor = [];
for (const mov of movements) movementsUSDfor.push(mov * eurToUsd);
console.log(movementsUSDfor);

const movementsDescriptions = movements.map(
  (mov, i) =>
    `Movement ${i + 1}: You ${mov > 0 ? 'deposited' : 'withdrew'} ${Math.abs(
      mov
    )}`
);
// ‚úçÔ∏è keep in mind why we actually get access to these 2 parameters here(286). All we do here is to pass this callback function into the map method. But we do not call this function by ourselves. It is the map method who we'll call this function for each of the array elements in the movement array. Each time that the map method calls or callback, it will simply pass in the current array element as well as the current index and the whole array.
// ‚úçÔ∏è there is a big, big difference between the map method and the forEach method. So before, we printed each line individually to the console, as we were looping over the array. So in each of the iteration, we performed some action that was then visible in the console and we can call this a side effect. So the forEach method creates SIDE EFFECTS. But now, here with this map method, all we did was to return each of the strings from the callback, and so basically they got added into a new array. And then finally we logged that entire array to the console and NOT THE ELEMENTS ONE BY ONE. And so here in this map method we did not create a side effect in each of the iteration. All we did was to build a brand new array.

// const movementsDescriptions = movements.map((mov, i, arr) => {
//   if (mov > 0) {
//     return `Movement ${i + 1}: You deposited ${mov}`;
//   } else {
//     return `Movement ${i + 1}: You withdraw ${Math.abs(mov)}`;
//   }
// }); // it's completely acceptable to have 2 return statements or even more in the same function as long as only one of them is executed

And so what we want is to simply loop over this array here, and then do something. And so for that, we use forEach.

// ‚úçÔ∏è instead of simply receiving one user, what we want to do is to receive all the accounts. So basically an array of account.

// Finally, we also need to RETURN this value here from the callback. And so this is how the new accumulator can then be used in the next iteration of the loop. So in each loop iteration, we return the updated accumulator(so the current one) + the new current value, and so like this, we can then keep adding to it in the next iteration.

// we could chain many other methods here as well, as long as they return NEW ARRAYS. filter returns a new array, the same goes for map, but reduce, will return a value. So here we could now not have chained a map or a filter after this. So we can only chain a method after another one, if the first one returns an array.

// ü™õ FOR DEBUG: we can inspect the current array at any stage of the pipeline using the third parameter of the callback function.

// ‚ö†Ô∏è 1. We should not overuse chaining. So we should try to optimize it, because chaining tons of methods one after the other can cause a real performance issues if we have really huge arrays. So if we have a huge chain of methods, chained one after the other, we should try to compress all the functionality that they do into as little methods as possible
// ex. sometimes we create way more map methods then we actually need, where we could just do it all in just one map call. So when you chain methods like this, keep looking for opportunities of keeping up your code's performance.
// ‚ö†Ô∏è 2. It is a bad practice to chain methods that mutate the underlying original array. And an example of that is the splice method. So you should not chain a method like the splice or the reverse method(in a large scale application).
// It's usually always a good practice to avoid mutating arrays.
